# Python Domain-Driven-Design(DDD) Example --- WIP
## Intro
I applied the DDD pattern to the ongoing project using FastAPI.
With DDD, readability is improved and complex business logic is much easier to understand.
As a result, productivity has been greatly improved and stable service/project management has become possible.
I am very satisfied with it, so I want to share this experience.

## Why DDD?
- Using DDD makes it easy to maintain collaboration with domain experts, not engineers.
- It is possible to prevent the mental model and the actually implemented software from being dualized.
- Business logic is easy to manage. 
- Infrastructure change is flexible.
